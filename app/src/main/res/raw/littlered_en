LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
Little Red Riding Hood, a girl in a red cloak, was sent by her mother to visit her grandmother. Along the way, she met a wolf who tricked her into revealing where she was going. The wolf raced to the grandmother's house, ate her, and disguised himself in her clothing. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, the wolf pretended to be her grandmother. But the girl noticed something was wrong and escaped before the wolf could harm her. A passing huntsman heard her screams, rescued her, and killed the wolf. They saved the grandmother, and Little Red Riding Hood learned to be cautious when talking to strangers in the woods.
