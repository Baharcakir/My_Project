HANSEL AND GRETEL
Hansel and Gretel were siblings left in the forest by their wicked stepmother. They found a house made of candy and sweets, owned by a witch who wanted to eat them. Hansel cleverly dropped breadcrumbs to find their way back, but the birds ate them. The witch locked Hansel in a cage to fatten him up. Gretel outsmarted the witch, pushing her into the oven. They freed the other children and found treasure. Returning home, they discovered their stepmother had died, and they lived happily ever after with their loving father.
