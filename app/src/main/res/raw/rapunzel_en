RAPUNZEL
Once upon a time, a couple longed for a child. They lived next to a garden belonging to a wicked witch named Gothel. When the wife, pregnant with cravings for Rapunzel, ate from Gothel's garden, the witch took their baby as payment. Named Rapunzel for the lettuce her mother craved, she grew up locked in a tower with only Gothel for company. Rapunzel's long hair became Gothel's ladder, until one day a prince climbed up. They fell in love, and Rapunzel helped him escape using her hair. Gothel, furious, cut Rapunzel's hair and banished her. After a time, the prince found Rapunzel, and her tears restored his sight. They returned to his kingdom, where they ruled wisely and well.
